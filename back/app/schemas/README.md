# Schemas

Schemas for interaction with the API are defined in this folder, both for input and output.

If the output and the input schemas do not differ from the defined base models, there is no need
to re-defined them in the schemas folder.

The name of the schema should be descriptive of the endpoint that it refers to,
and also containe the respective **Response** or **Request** at the end of it.
